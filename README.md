#  Car Price Prediction Model

A Machine Learning project that predicts the **selling price of a car** based on various features such as brand, model year, fuel type, transmission, mileage, and more.

This project demonstrates the **end-to-end ML workflow** including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

##  Project Overview

Car price prediction is a common real-world regression problem in data science.  
In this project, a supervised machine learning model is trained on historical car data to estimate the **market price of used cars**.
